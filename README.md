### Brief Account of Experimentation
- I tried to apply three different API's. I applied a Chuck Norris joke API because when I tried to use the API that was shown in the task it didn't work so I tried to start with something similar but more simple. I then applied the Dog API which I would like to improve but for now I just want to see if I understand how API's work. I finally added a DND5e API to solidify my understanding of API's. Unlike the other API links, I tried to randomize the results of the DND5e API because I wanted to see if I could manipulate the results of the API while the other API's already randomize everytime the page loads. I also used the p5js reference page (https://p5js.org/reference/p5/textWrap/) to get `textWrap(WORD);` because the Chuck Norris jokes would sometimes go off the canvas so I used the code to control it, although I can't say the same thing for the Dog API as the url would also be larger than the canvas.

### Problem Solving
- Not really problem solving but when I was trying to apply the API's shown in the workshop they wouldn't work so I tried to use an API that was similar to what was being shown in the task (which ended up being the Chuck Norris API). So when I finished applying the CN API, I got rid of the other code that was meant to be for the workshop video API.

### Future Development
- With the Dog API, I want to be able to show the image that the Dog API link relates to but I couldn't figure out how to because to my understanding I need to preload the image before showing it and so I modified the code to have a preload function. Although there is code to theoretically reveal the image, while trying to test the code out, the page took too long to load. I'm not sure whether it was working or whether it was stuck but I decided to abort the code and go for something simple. For the DND API, I want to make it so that the class that was randomly chosen constantly changes.
